# HabboQuests Community Suggestions
Inspired by the dear-github project, this is a repository that uses GitHub Issues to propose changes to be made to the website. This is not to report bugs.

I recommend to either add a :thumbsup: or a :thumbsdown: emoji to topics that you either support or do not support.

We only ask that you keep the discussion on-topic. If there are any changes or extra information that you believe should be added to this repository, feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
